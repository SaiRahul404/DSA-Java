    // The if statement allows a program to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
    //  The else statement provides an alternative block of code to be executed if the
    //  condition of the preceding if statement (or else if statement) is false.

    // switch statement: The "Fixed Menu" Choice
    // The switch statement is like a restaurant menu where you have a few fixed options.
    // You don't have complex "if this and that" conditions; you just pick one item from a list.
    // case option1:: "If you pick 'Pizza', cook pizza."
    //
    //case option2:: "If you pick 'Pasta', cook pasta."

    // break;: This is crucial!
    //Without break;, your program would keep executing the code for the next options too, which is usually not what you want.
    // default:: "If you pick anything else not on the menu, just bring water." This is like the else of the if statement â€“
    // it runs if none of the case options match.

    // Use if, else if, else when you have complex conditions  or when you have a wide range of possibilities.
    // Use switch when you have a fixed set of specific values you're checking against
    // It's often cleaner and sometimes more efficient for such scenarios than a long chain of else if statements.

    // Programs to check if a number is positive/negative/zero.
    //Program to determine if a person is eligible to vote/drive.
